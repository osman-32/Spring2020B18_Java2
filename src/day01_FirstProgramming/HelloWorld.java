                    This is my first java programming.
                    My strugles: Not figuring out forming a project file under src file.
                                 So that i repeated the two days from begginning to end
                                 becuase Gonul had teeth problem so that we went to Birmingham
                                 that is why i missed second day class and missed the topics.
